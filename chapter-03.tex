\textsc{``I cannot} agree to this, H'aanit. It's too dangerous.'' Olberic's face was grim -- but that was only natural. The party was in the Frostland town of Stillsnow. Just as the name suggested, the town was blanketed year-round in a layer of silver-glittering snow, but the blizzard raging outside was unusual in its ferocity even for the Frostlands. The windows of the lodge, which should have assuredly been more than sturdy enough to withstand a snowstorm, rattled perilously, and the view outside, even though it was nighttime, was nothing but pure white as far as the eye could see. Yet amidst the fierce snow, H'aanit was determined to search for Ophilia.

``I knowe 'twill be dangerous -- but I do not intende to doen anything rash, nor am I without preparation.'' H'aanit's voice was strained, but still possessed of a certain firmness. Hers certainly was not the voice of someone who had lost their cool.

``But...''

``'Tis no trouble for me to followen Linde's tracks, even if they be faint, and the place is not so far from here.''

It was a few hours ago that the party had been separated from Ophilia. Snow began to fall as they left the white forest behind and were making their way back to Stillsnow, and although the distance wasn't particularly far, their vision was stolen in an instant. Disoriented by the harsh snowfall, Ophilia took a wrong step, lost her balance, and slipped away from the rest of the group.

Ordinarily, it would be a given for ever-attentive Ophilia to proceed with caution and certainty, even in such harsh conditions. Yet for the past several days, she had been clearly wracked by some kind of worry, and it had begun to tinge her behavior with a certain lifelessness -- ultimately culminating in her slip and fall. H'aanit had rushed over in an instant and stretched out her arm, but couldn't get ahold of Ophilia's arm. With a blank expression on her face, as though she herself wasn't quite sure what was happening, Ophilia disappeared into the snow in the blink of an eye.

As her companions rushed to find a way to rescue her, the one who acted with the greatest clarity of purpose was none other than the snow leopard Linde. H'aanit exchanged a brief glance with her companion and understood what Linde meant to do at once. Some food, alcohol, and the other bare necessities to endure the bitter cold were strapped to Linde's body before she, too, disappeared into the snow, determined to follow after Ophilia.

Unfortunately, as long as the party was unable to properly get their own equipment and supplies in order, it was too dangerous to remain in the middle of the blizzard any longer. There was nothing else for them to do but make the trek back to Stillsnow.

``Linde haileth from the Frostlands,'' H'aanit said as she donned her pelts and laced snowshoes to her boots. ``Even amidst a blizzard such as this, 'twould be a trifle to finden her quarry. I've no doubt she is fast at Ophilia's side by now -- but whether she is unharmed is a separate question, indeed.'' H'aanit cast her gaze towards the snowstorm on the other side of the window. ``In conditions such as these, the danger that she maye freeze to death only groweth, and Linde's tracks willen growe harder to finden. If we are to searchen after her...''

Cyrus, who had remained silent until now, interjected, ``I see. The time to follow after her is now, while we can still hope for both her safety and finding Linde's tracks,''

``...Just so.'' H'aanit nodded. Olberic's expression remained severe, and he let out a groan.

``Still, it's dangerous for you to travel alone. Perhaps it would be better to have someone else accompany you...''

``I'm not so sure of that, Olberic.'' Cyrus laced his fingers together before the fireplace. ``Someone like H'aanit, a hunter from S'warkii, might be accustomed to navigating the middle of a blizzard like this, but I don't know if we can say the same of anyone else. I'm sure a knight of Hornberg has some experience traveling through snow, but I doubt you've had to weather a snowstorm like this -- am I right?''

``...It's as you say.'' Olberic sighed. H'aanit imagined that was precisely the cause for his concern -- Olberic was the only member of their party with experience commanding troops, and that made him all the more inclined to take up the role of opposing any rash movements as a matter of principle.  On the other hand, it was as Cyrus said. H'aanit was more than accustomed to pursuing a target through even the worst conditions; she hadn't imagined the day would come where being forced to handle all her master's countless unreasonable requests would come in handy like this. She hardly wanted to suggest that bringing anyone else would just get in her way, but there was no denying that for something so time-sensitive, she would prefer to be able to move as lightly as possible.

As the party continued to mull over the best course of action, the door opened with a \emph{bang}, and snow-bearing wind entered the lodge room along with Primrose, shivering even while bundled up in her coat. As she dusted the snow from her hair with a grim look on her face.

``We had a chat with the people at Arianna's brothel -- they said once the storm calms a little more, they could arrange a carriage for us.''

``But at this rate, it's hard to say when exactly that'll be,'' Therion added, entering a little after Primrose, as he shut the door behind him. H'aanit thought over their predicament once more and finally said,

``There's no need for worry, Olberic. 'Tis heartening to knowen your concern, but I am not one to acten rashly -- rather, I am all too often one to advisen others against doing so. Should I determine it too perilous to proceeden, I shall returne at once.''

``...Very well.'' Olberic finally nodded, defeated. ``But please don't do anything risky, H'aanit. You know the saying -- the tiger bites he who chases after rabbits.\endnote{I have no clue if this is referencing something from the game; as far as I can tell though, it's not an existing Japanese proverb. For reference, the original is 「\ruby{兎}{うさぎ}を\ruby{追}{お}って\ruby{虎}{とら}に\ruby{嚙}{か}まれる」}'' 

``You wouldt really use such a proverb with a hunter of S'warkii?''

Ceding the fireside to Primrose and Therion, Cyrus chuckled. ``Speaking of proverbs, Olberic, perhaps `telling Bifelgan about his own bounty'\endnote{\textbf{Editing note:} I'd like to find a pithier way to phrase this; the original is literally something like `explaining market prices [of stocks] to [Bifelgan] the Trader'} would be more appropriate?'' After that, Olberic could really do nothing but let out a long sigh and shake his head, conceding at last, before allowing the corners of his mouth to slacken into a small smile.

``Quite right. Godspeed, H'aanit -- we'll leave Ophilia to you.''

At last fully dressed to keep the cold at bay, H'aanit, voice muffled by the pelt covering her mouth, replied, ``Of course.''

``H'aanit!'' ``Miss H'aanit!'' Before H'aanit could walk out the door, she was stopped by Alfyn and Tressa calling from behind. ``Ya never know what could happen out there -- lemme give you some salve for frostbite, okay?''

``And here's a hearthstone! If you get too cold, you can use it like a hot water bottle!''

``My thanks to you both.'' H'aanit nodded and accepted their parting gifts before opening the door and stepping outside. Throwing herself into the middle of the snowstorm, awaited by her companion and her partner, she, too, melted into the silver-tinted landscape before long.

Thank you so much to \href{https://twitter.com/__digitaldreams}{Crescent} of Octopath Traveler longfic fame for helping to write H'aanit's dialogue for this chapter (since there's so much of it haha). H'aanit's Middle English mannerisms are an invention of the localizers (she just uses standard polite speech in Japanese), giving me little to work with, so their assistance in making it both consistent and readable was invaluable.
