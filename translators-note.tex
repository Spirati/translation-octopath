I would also like to note that I am not a native Japanese speaker, nor am I a professional translator. Some trickier parts of this book have been verified by native speakers, but the vast majority have not. In truth, this is much more of a personal exercise in both my English writing ability and my Japanese reading comprehension that I also happen to be releasing to the broader public. This translation is a living work, and I intend to go back and revise parts over time. If you have any questions about the original text or my writing choices, I'm more than happy to field them on either my \href{https://plvpwaa.tumblr.com}{Tumblr} or my \href{https://twitter.com/plvpwaa}{Twitter}. For the curious, the \LaTeX \space source for this book as well as its revision history are available on my \href{https://github.com/Spirati/translation-octopath}{GitHub}. 

Happy reading!
