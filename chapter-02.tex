"\textsc{Whew,} that was a real piece of work, I'll tell you!" Alfyn made a funny sort of whole-body gesture as he related the party's grand exploits in Noblecourt. Sunlight spilled over the table, and the beautiful girl with short-cropped golden hair seated across from him giggled as she listened to Alfyn's (somewhat embellished) story. So we set the scene: a tea party in the garden of the Ravus estate. How Alfyn came to participate will require a little explanation.

Alfyn was continuing to travel alongside his seven companions. They were a motley bunch with respect to origin, vocation, and motivations, but they got along well, and continued to support one another in working towards their respective goals. For one of those companions, Therion, the thief, the reason he had embarked on his journey was indeed that very House Ravus. In the course of their travels, the party made a stop in Bolderfall and decided it may not be a bad idea to say hello while they were there. And so, they had been invited to a tea party. As such, the girl now listening eagerly to Alfyn's tale was of course the current head of House Ravus, Cordelia Ravus. 

Alfyn, evidently quite charmed by his own storytelling, recounted to Cordelia one after another the events of one of the party's most recent exploits.

``And so, we walked way upstream -- turned out, there was a fella there poaching all the fish! No matter how much we talked to him, he jus' wouldn't listen, so Mr. Olberic and H'aanit...''

``Oh, my. So how did all it turn out?''

``Well, eventually all the fish came back to the river just fine, so it all wrapped up with a happy ending! Tressa wouldn't stop fumin' the whole time, though -- said she couldn't believe someone would hog all those fish to themselves like that, way more than anyone could eat.''

So far only Alfyn had been chatting up a storm, but of course he was not the only one there. A little behind Cordelia stood her butler, Heathcote, and Therion, naturally, occupied a seat as well. He hadn't spoken a single word since they arrived, and the tea prepared for him sat untouched on the table. Therion had been adamantly opposed to the idea of stopping by House Ravus in the first place, so perhaps that was only natural. Alfyn had had to drag the man half by force out of the inn. Primrose had joined them as well. \emph{So that you don't offend our noble hosts}, apparently.

``Would you care for another cup of tea, madam?''

``Yes, I'd love one.'' She smiled softly at Heathcote -- as always, she was unmatched in her grace and elegance. Alfyn was reminded once again how different her upbringing was from his own.

``I'm glad you're here to share all these interesting stories. Since Mr. Therion won't talk at all...''

``No kiddin'!'' Alfyn crossed his arms and nodded in firm agreement. Then, for the first time, Therion opened his mouth.

``It's only natural. I've got no need to talk to you. The only thing I agreed to do for you was steal back the three dragonstones. Am I wrong?''

``W-well, yes, but...'' Cordelia seemed to lose her words at Therion's accusatory tone. She hung her head.

``H-hey now, Therion, there's no need for all that, is there?''

``Once again. Am I wrong, medicine man?''

``I'm not sayin' you're wrong, just the way you're saying it is a bit rough, is all.''

``Hmph. Don't care.'' Therion had embarked on his journey to steal back House Ravus' three missing dragonstones. Of course, he wasn't doing it out of a sense of duty or out of the kindness of his heart. [GO BACK TO TRANSLATE THIS SENTENCE LATER LMFAO PAGE 72] At any rate, Therion had pledged to use his skills as a thief to steal back the heirlooms of House Ravus. Alfyn had actually helped Therion out to steal one of the dragonstones from a scholar in Noblecourt. [THIS ONE TOO SOB] Therion then returned to Bolderfall to deliver the stone to Heathcote and Cordelia directly. Alfyn hadn't accompanied him, of course, but he was pretty certain Therion didn't go in order to boast about his success at the work that had been foisted upon him. \emph{(Well, he ain't exactly the guy to brag about his accomplishments in the first place, is he...)} Alfyn thought, watching Therion's demeanor.

Primrose cut in before the atmosphere could sour any further. ``Oh, Alfyn, how about you tell her \emph{that} story next? It's quite the tale, after all.''

``\emph{That} story?''

``From before we arrived in Bolderfall. It was quite the struggle fighting off that herd of monsters, wasn't it?''

``Oh... Ohhhh, right, \emph{that} story! Yeah, alright!'' Alfyn once again clapped his hands and nodded with gusto.

It had happened only yesterday, a couple days after making their way into the Cliftlands. Bolderfall was right before there eyes when they were attacked by a flock of Birdians. Alfyn wouldn't go so far as to say it was `quite the struggle,' though. As she often did while the party made camp, Ophilia had split off to pray when she was set upon by the Birdians. The rest of the party had rushed to her aid immediately, though, and made short work of fending them off. Still, Primrose had a good idea -- if Alfyn could spice up the story a little bit to make it more of a thrilling tale, they could salvage the tea party's rapidly-sinking mood. Primrose really was handy to have around at times like this.

``...I think I'll take my leave now, then,'' Therion muttered, standing from his chair.

``Eh? O-oh, let me at least see you out, then, Mr. Therion...''

``Don't bother. We're here in the first place because our medicine man over here said we should come greet you all. We've greeted you all. So I don't have any reason to stick around, do I?''

``W-well...''

``I don't need you looking after my well-being. Either way, I'll take back the last two dragonstones.'' Therion's voice was as icy as ever. Cordelia made to follow him out anyway, but Heathcote stopped her. The gentleman's gaze, vigorous despite his age, met hers, and he shook his head softly. Cordelia clenched her fists and lowered her head. 

``I understand what Mr. Therion is saying, but... I mean, I'm the one who put the cuff on him in the first place...''

``I see. You made a pact with Therion that you'd remove the Fool's Bangle if he returned your heirlooms, is that right?'' Primrose nodded at Cordelia's words and set her teacup down. ``Then I imagine he has some rather complex feelings towards you. Please, try not to take too much offense at it.''

``No, it's not that I'm offended, I just...''

``...On top of that, I have a feeling that the reason he left is simply that the story Alfyn is about to tell might be rather embarrassing for him.''

``Eh...?'' Primrose chuckled a little; Cordelia's shock was written all over her face.

``You see, when Ophilia was attacked by monsters, the very first person to come to her aid was Therion, after all. Isn't that right, Alfyn?''

``H-Huh? Y'know, now that you mention it, you're right...'' At that time, Therion simply happened to be the closest to Ophilia's location, but the way Primrose said it made it sound as though he'd rushed to her side like a knight in shining armor. He was the closest, so he moved the fastest -- it really didn't go any further than that.
